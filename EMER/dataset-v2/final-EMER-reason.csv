He is looking down with his gaze lowered, which may suggest that their emotions are more negative or heavy. This emotion may stem from frustration, self-doubt, or feeling uneasy about one's own evaluation. Overall, the character's mood is quite negative, but specific emotions need to be analyzed in conjunction with additional context. In the audio, the tone is quite heavy. Combined with the text content, one can sense the character's self-blame and guilt. In the text, the subtitle reads, ""Aunt Pang would not have done these extreme actions. So it's all my fault."" From the subtitle, one can infer the emotional state of the male character. Based on the serious facial expression, lowered head, downward gaze in the video clues, as well as the description of a heavy tone, self-blame, and guilt in the audio clues, it can be deduced that the male character may feel very guilty and self-blaming. He believes that Aunt Pang would not have taken extreme actions, so he blames himself and thinks that it is all his fault. This indicates that the male character may have made a mistake or acted inappropriately in some aspect, resulting in negative consequences, which triggered his feelings of guilt and self-blame."
